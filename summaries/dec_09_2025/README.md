## Notes:
- Adds an aggregate plot to the summary. Don't read into these plots, the per target performance is what matters
- Adds comparison plots for each set against the the results of the Dec 08 2025 run, which used OpenFF 2.2.1.
- Repeat of December 8th summary, but with OpenFF 2.0.0 and run on a machine with a RTX 5090 and RTX 5080
- Hif2a Ligand 35 still has an incorrect experimental [label](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/65281c688bab5d205536cc7b).
